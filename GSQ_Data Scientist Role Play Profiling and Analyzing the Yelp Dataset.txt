Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just 
like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the 
code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question 
you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, 
on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers 
and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, 
Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, 
just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.

In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.

Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1.	Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:

i.	Attribute table = 10000
ii.	Business table = 10000
iii.	Category table = 10000
iv.	Checkin table = 10000
v.	elite_years table = 10000
vi.	friend table = 10000
vii.	hours table = 10000
viii.	photo table = 10000
ix.	review table = 10000
x.	tip table = 10000
xi.	user table = 10000

2.	Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, 
	please specify which foreign key.

i.	Business = 10000
ii.	Hours = 1562
iii.	Category = 2643
iv.	Attribute = 1115   
v.	Review = 10000  
vi.	Checkin = 493
vii.	Photo = 10000
viii.	Tip = 537
ix.	User = 10000
x.	Friend = 11
xi.	Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	

3.	Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No

		FROM business
		WHERE city ='Beachwood'
		GROUP BY stars

	Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns – star rating and count):
	+-------+-------+
	| stars | count |
	+-------+-------+
	|   2.0 |     1 |

	| Sara   |         1629 |
	| Yuri   |         1339 |
	+--------+--------------+

8.	Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

	The correlation between the number of reviews and the number of fans is not necessarily direct.  For example, in an analysis of Yelp data, 
	it was found that the user with the most fans had only 253 reviews, while another user with only 76 fans had 1339 reviews. 
	This suggests that while reviews can contribute to gaining fans,  they are not the only factor. Other aspects such as the quality of the reviews, 
	the reputation of the reviewer, and the  relevance of the reviews to the interests of potential fans may also play significant roles.

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
		SELECT range AS fans_range, 
       		COUNT(*) AS num_user, 
       		AVG(review_COUNT) AS avg_num_review,     
       		AVG(fans) AS avg_num_fans
		FROM (SELECT CASE WHEN fans BETWEEN 0 AND 9 THEN '0 - 9'
                 	WHEN fans BETWEEN 10 AND 99 THEN '10 - 99'
                  	ELSE '100-1000' END AS range, review_COUNT, fans
      			FROM user) AS subtable
     		GROUP BY subtable.range

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. 
Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

I chose the city "Las Vegas" and category "Restaurants"
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

ANS: Yes. They all have different time distributions for each day.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

ANS: Yes. Those that has 2-3 stars has a high review count while those with 4-5 stars has only a few review count.
                  
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

ANS: Yes because we have the address column available in the database. Those with 2-3 stars are located in 5045 W Tropicana Ave while having 4-5 stars
are located in 1910 Village Center Cir, Unit 1.

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the 
ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:

ANS: The restaurant that is open have more number of reviews which is 269,300 than the restaurant that is closed which has only reviews of 35,261.
                  
ii. Difference 2:

ANS: The restaurant that is open have slightly higher star rating which is 3.68 than the restaurant that is closed which has only a star rating of 3.52.                   
         
SQL CODE FOR ANALYSIS:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)), AVG(review_count), SUM(review_count), AVG(stars), is_open
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the 
data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies 
between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples 
to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

ANS: I chose to do a sentiment analysis on the reviews of restaurants in Las Vegas. This analysis will help understand the customer sentiment 
towards restaurants in Las Vegas, which can be useful for both businesses and customers.   
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

ANS: The analysis I’ve chosen necessitates a specific set of data from the Yelp dataset. The primary component is the review text, which serves as 
a rich source of user sentiment. These reviews, penned by customers, encapsulate their experiences and feelings towards the businesses they’ve interacted with.

In addition to the review text, the star ratings provided by the users are also crucial. These ratings offer a quantifiable measure of user sentiment, providing 
a scale to gauge customer satisfaction. Lastly, the category of the business is required to ensure that the analysis is focused solely on Restaurants. This 
allows us to filter out irrelevant data and concentrate our analysis on the Restaurant industry.
                                             
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

ANS: The output dataset will contain the columns: id (Review ID), text (Review Text), stars (Stars given by the user), and category (Category of the business). 
Each row will represent a review given by a user to a restaurant in Las Vegas.

| -3Z4lmpcHpMTzHmm9g8kWw | My brother was in town and wanted to get a quick lunch before I had to go into work. Wanted to go into Monta but it was 11 and they weren't open yet, so we stopped in at the Big Wong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |     4 | Restaurants |

|                        | Beef Ramen - for 5 you can get a bowl of ramen (same noodles as used at Monta) and it comes with big chunks of beef. They'll ask you for tendons too and I don't remember if they charge you extra, but I don't think so. Came with chili oil, scallions, and siracha on the side. It was good, and it's exactly what you expect to get, ramen and beef. Great flavor and the broth was well seasoned. |       |             |
